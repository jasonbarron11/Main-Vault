# Getting Started

Getting Started Once each player has chosen their hero and everyone is ready to play, it’s time to begin the game. Make sure everyone has their character sheet, and put the dice where everyone can reach them. The map should be in the middle of the table, and each player should place the pawn for their hero just off the map, near Area 1 on the first level of the dungeon. Once everyone is ready to begin, start by reading the text in green below to set the scene.
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The small seaside town of Otari is known for its fresh fish and skilled sailors, but above all, it’s a big logging town, providing valuable wood to the nearby metropolis of Absalom. But for you, Otari is home. You grew up playing on the docks, getting lost in the nearby woods, and hearing the fantastical stories of travelers from faraway lands, tales of terrifying dragons and virtuous knights. Such adventure always seemed so distant—until today! 
> 
> Word has begun to spread around Otari that there’s a problem down at the Otari Fishery. Some are saying that some sort of beast is lurking in the basement, feeding on the stores of salted fish. Folks are worried that whatever is eating the fish might get hungry enough to eat the fishers next! You’ve received a letter from Tamily Tanderveil, the owner of the Fishery. Inside is a desperate plea for help. 
> 
> With the town guard busy protecting the loggers, she needs a few brave souls to venture down into the basement of her warehouse and put an end to the beast that’s feasting on her fish! Do you have the courage to face the menace under Otari?

After you finish reading, have the players introduce their heroes to one another, including their name, ancestry, background, and class. Players might also want to describe what their hero looks like, what kind of gear they carry, and maybe a bit about their personality. You can also show them the picture of Tamily on this page so they can see who’s asking them to take on this task. After the introductions, have the players place their pawns on the stairs leading down into the basement in Area 1. The order is up to them to decide, but it’s smart to put characters with more Hit Points or a higher Armor Class in front. Make sure that one character is at the bottom of the stairs, then turn to Area 1 on page 4.
> [!Experience Points]+ 
> After overcoming various challenges in the game, the heroes earn Experience Points (XP) to represent their growing skills. These awards always appear in green boxes like this one. Whenever the heroes earn XP, each hero gets the listed amount and adds it to the XP they already have. When a hero gets 1,000 XP, they go up a level!

 # 1. Hungry Rats!
![[Map1.PNG|right|600]]The first encounter happens in the basement of the Otari Fishery. Before starting, get the [[Giant-Rat|Giant Rats]]  pawns from the box. You’ll need one giant rat for each player. When you’re ready, read the following to the players.
> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The stairs leading into the basement of the Otari Fishery creak with age as you make your way downstairs to find the beast that has been eating all the fish. In the center of the room, between stone pillars holding up the fishery overhead, are barrels filled with salted fish. Two of these barrels have been smashed open, spilling their contents on the floor. In the east wall is a large hole, opening into darkness. Just a few hours ago, you gathered with a few other adventurers in the office of Tamily Tanderveil’s office, where she offered you ten gold pieces each if you could put an end to this menace. She was thrilled when you agreed to help her with this simple task, but as you make your way downstairs, you can’t help but wonder if this might be a lot more adventure than you bargained for.

Go around the table and ask each player the first thing they want their hero to do in the room. As each player describes their action, allow them to move their pawn around this area, but don’t let them leave the room just yet. The shelves along the walls on the north and south sides of the room are piled high with general supplies that belong to the fishery. Heroes who investigate the hole in the wall on the east side of the room find piles of loose rock and dirt on the inside of the room. It looks like something has broken open the wall from the other side! After each player has had a chance to do one thing, an ominous skittering noise comes from the hole in the wall— [[Giant-Rat|Giant Rats]] emerge to attack! Read the following to the players:

> A strange chittering comes from the hole in the wall. Suddenly, a massive rat the size of a dog emerges from the darkness—and it isn’t alone! The giant rats rush toward you, their huge teeth snapping.

#### THE FIRST COMBAT 
The heroes are now in combat with four giant rats. Place the pawns for the rats on the map as shown on the map above, near the hole in the east wall. In combat, each player takes turns and follows specific rules about what they can and can’t do. See the next page for step-by-step instructions on how to handle combat. The giant rats’ statistics are below. Only the statistics relevant to this combat are included, but you can find the rest on page 75 if you need them. Roll a d20 and add the giant rats’ Perception to find their initiative. The rats all take their turns at the same time, but each one acts independently. On its turn, each rat moves toward a different hero and attacks. If a hero falls unconscious, the rat moves to the next nearest and attacks.

#### Attacks
![[giant rats.PNG|left|600]]When a creature uses the Strike action to make an attack, first pick a target. A creature must be in a space next to its target (including diagonally) to use a melee Strike, such as the rats’ jaws Strike. Roll a d20 and add the statistic for that attack. For the giant rats’ Strike, you’ll add 7 to the number that comes up on the die. Then compare the total against the Armor Class (AC) of the hero being attacked. If the rat’s total is equal to or higher than the hero’s AC, the rat hits! It deals the amount of damage listed in the Damage section of that [[Strike]]. In this case, roll 1d6 and add 1 to determine the damage it deals—the hero loses that many Hit Points. If you roll a 20 on the die, or the total is at least 10 more than the hero’s Armor Class, it’s a critical hit! These deal twice as much damage: roll 1d6 and add 1, then double the number to determine the damage.


#### AFTER COMBAT 
Once one side is defeated or flees, you don’t need to track actions anymore and heroes no longer need to act in order. Instead, go around the table and ask the players what the heroes would like to do next. If the heroes return to talk to Tamily, she’s relieved to learn that the rats are dead, but she is certain that rats couldn’t have caused all of the destruction below. The heroes will have to explore further if they want to earn their reward. When the players decide to explore beyond this room, turn to Area 2 on page 6.
